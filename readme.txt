this is a quiz Application.....created by Ankit Chouhan
this app is totally work on client side.
languages used in this are:
                        html
                        css
                        javascrpt
we have used object concept to store question and there answers,
when it start, 1st question comes across to answer , it will not allow to move forword if student does not select any option among the four choices. 
it checks ,if any option is checked or not, if yes then you can switch to the next question.
then we check the selected choice of student that he has answered with the correct answer stored as an object property. If the answer is correct then it increment the score with 1 .
same process happens till the last qustion and test will be submitted.
in last it shows your result and ask for restart the test again.



thankyou
